My solution to the Reaktor summer developer 2021 pre-assignment.

## Problem Description  
Your client is a clothing brand that is looking for a simple web app to use in their warehouses. To do their work efficiently, the warehouse workers need a fast and simple listing page per product category, where they can check simple product and availability information from a single UI. There are three product categories they are interested in for now: gloves, facemasks, and beanies. Therefore, you should implement three web pages corresponding to those categories that list all the products in a given category. One requirement is to be easily able to switch between product categories quickly. You are free to implement any UI you want, as long as it can display multiple products at once in a straightforward and explicit listing. At this point, it is not necessary to implement filtering or pagination functionality on the page.

The client does not have a ready-made API for this purpose. Instead, they have two different legacy APIs that combined can provide the needed information. The legacy APIs are on critical-maintenance-only mode, and thus further changes to them are not possible. The client knows the APIs are not excellent, but they are asking you to work around any issues in the APIs in your new application. The client has instructed you that both APIs have an internal cache of about 5 minutes.  

## Solution Description
The proxy server requests the data from the legacy APIs, combines it and stores it inside a Redis database.
The frontend application can then request the composed data from the proxy server and show it to the user. The server tries to update the data from the legacy APIs every 5 minutes.
